PhaseGAN: A Phase-Regenerating GAN for a Lightweight, Artifact-Free, and High-Fidelity Mel-Spectrogram Neural Vocoder

We present our audio samples as follows:

​​LJSpeech​​: Demonstrates the performance of our method and baseline models on the LJSpeech test set.

​​VCTK​​: Evaluates our method and baseline models (trained on LJSpeech) on unseen speakers without fine-tuning.

​​Opencpop​​: Tests our method and baseline models (trained on LJSpeech) on singing voice data without fine-tuning.

​​Ablation Study​​: Features ablation samples from LJSpeech, including:

Results without the adversarial loss module

Results without MRSTFT components
